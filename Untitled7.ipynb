    "\"\"\"6ans) Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use specific exception types: Catching specific exception types allows you to handle different types of errors in different ways. This can help you write more robust and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use try-except blocks sparingly: Try-except blocks can make code harder to read and understand. Use them only when necessary and keep them as short as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Exceptions should be handled at the appropriate level of abstraction. For example, if an exception occurs in a low-level function, \n",
    "it should be handled in that function or propagated up to a higher-level function that can handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide informative error messages: Error messages should be informative and helpful. They should explain what went wrong and provide guidance on how to fix the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the finally block for cleanup: The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. Use it for cleanup tasks such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Don't catch exceptions you can't handle: Catching exceptions you can't handle can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. Only catch exceptions you know how to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use context managers: Context managers, such as the \"with\" statement, can help ensure that resources are properly managed and cleaned up, even in the event of an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Log exceptions: Logging exceptions can help with debugging and troubleshooting. Use a logging library to log exceptions and other important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Test exception handling: Test your code to ensure that exception handling works as expected. Write test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable code that handles exceptions effectively and gracefully."
